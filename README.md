# audio-switcher-esp8266
A bit of micropython code to go with my Wemos D1mini audio switcher

## What is it?
This is very much a work in progress and has two functions:

- an interface to control the audio switcher circuit for my pre-amp when a button is pressed
- a means to provide a completely pointless web remote control interface for that audio switcher

It's also a first attempt to play with websockets.

I'll post the circuit diagram, BOM and gerber files when I've confirmed that the circuit I've designed actually works.
